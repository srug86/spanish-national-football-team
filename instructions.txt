INSTRUCTIONS:

Make a responsive, interactive web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Create a web page about yourself or a subject you are interested in, using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Your submission should consist of 3 files:

* A HTML document
* A CSS document
* A JavaScript document 

You can also upload additional files such as jQuery or Bootstrap if needed. 

The web page should have the following features:

* It should display correctly if the person viewing it has placed all the files you have supplied in a folder on their machine
* It should use at least one of each of HTML img, h1 and div tags (and more if needed)
* It should use CSS to set the style of the text and other parts of the design as appropriate, in at least 3 ways.
* It should be responsive - it should change the layout if the screen size changes
* The user should be able to change the page in some way by interacting with a GUI element such as a button. 

Write some text on the page explaining how the user can interact. You should implement this feature using JavaScript.
